# scripts


save_install.sh
I am sure there is a better solution for this somewhere, but here we are. 
Run like this ./save_install.sh "package_name" 

Prompts if you want to save this package in a list to keep track of the actual important packages, without some of the clutter that you might have to install. 

Possible improvements
Creation of packages.txt file if it does not exist
installation script which install all packages from this list
